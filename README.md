# sql_business_questions
In this repo I will be using the SQLite sample chinook database to answer hypothetical business questions, demonstrating various intermediate and complex SQL techniques that can be used to help business analysis.

The Chinook database covers data from a hypothetical record store. We will be looking to answer 3 hypothetical questions:

1. Finding which genres sell best in the USA to maximise profits from advertisement.
2. Analysing employee sales performance to figure out the best performing employees.
3. Analysing sales data by country to find the most profitable markets, and markets with potential investment opportunity
